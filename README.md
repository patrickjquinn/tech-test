Some short sample code which demonstrates how to perform flattening of an array of ints with nested arrays and filtering JSON by Geo distance.

## Setup & Run

- Install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- To run the flatten sample run `node flatten.js` and observe the console output (Modify `array` in order to change inputs).
- To run the geo JSON filter example run `node customers-sort.js` and observe the output (You can modify the target distance in Km via the `TARGET_DISTANCE_AWAY` constant)
